  <h2>Angles and latency make a huge difference.</h2>
    <h4>Ever been confused by why your opponent's move worked? You may have a vague understanding of angles and latency, but not how to take advantage or take control in your game. This article will explain how to use angles and latency to master your peaking technique in games to see enemies before they see you.</h4>
  
  <h3>Understanding Angles</h3>
  <p>Angles might seem simple but gets rather complex quite quickly. Understanding angles can give a player a massive improvement in performance and should be considered a core mechanic. In games, more often than not, there is a line of sight from the character's head that creates what you see on your screen. We must understand that when we are in cover, our vision might be covered but not anything else.</p>
    
  <p class="content">In the following images, the green ball is to represent one character while the red a second.</p>

      <figcaption>Here we can see that the red character can see the green character quite well.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>It's clear there is a relationship between the position of the characters and how much they see of the other- especially in relation to obstacles or cover- but there is a lot more we can get from this relationship.</p>

      <figcaption>This time the lines represent the point at which they can last see behind the obstacle.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>As Green moves towards the obstacle, the less the can see, and  they see less with each step- likewise, each step moving away is worth slightly less than the one before. You can imagine it like moving a flashlight closer and farther from an object. We will now add a use for this property. I understand this image may seem complicated at first- you will likely understand better if you see the next few.</p>

  <h2>History and Development of the Dvorak Layout</h2>
  <h3>The Vision of Dr. August Dvorak</h3>
  <p>Purposely designed to be better than QWERTY - extensive research by August Dvorak and his brother William went into finding typing patterns and finger movement. The layout hoped to achieve minimal finger movement. Once again - blocked by QWERTY... however, in the typing and programming/coding communities, Dvorak is associated with efficiency, typing speed, and comfort.</p>
  
  <h3>Adoption Over Time</h3>
  <p>With the advance of technology, it became easier and easier to swap out a keyboard layout. Even today - one does not need to actively switch layouts to try it, websites such as keybr or monkeytype exist and can emulate the layout for each individual. The increase in accessibility has led QWERTY alternatives to rise, and with the added benefits along with its prevalence in the programming community, Dvorak has risen sharply.</p>

  <h2>Why Programmers Prefer Dvorak</h2>
  <h3>Well, why wouldn't they..</h3>
  <p>Dvorak allows programmers to have much more comfort when typing for longer - allowing programmers to focus more on their thinking and processing instead of being distracted by fatigue. The comma and period are also much more conveniently placed for programming allowing for greater continuity. The reputation is already built even if it is not as great as QWERTY, so there are no risks, only the learning curve....</p>

  <h2>Transitioning to Dvorak</h2>
  <h3>Learning Curve.</h3>
  <p>Changing a keyboard layout can indeed be a complex and time-consuming process. There are also some decisions to make. Typically, it's best to completely switch, but be aware that if you do, you will gradually lose your ability to type in QWERTY. For me, QWERTY was the first layout I learned, but I decided to keep practicing it while learning other layouts. Now, I can switch between them very rapidly.</p>
<p>
A great example is YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocRmykVd9UE">"Jashe Poon"</a>, who holds an incredible words-per-minute record for switching between three layouts in one run on Monkeytype's "layout fluid" mode (a mode that mixes Dvorak, QWERTY, and Colemak).
</p>
<p>
If the user decides to fully commit to learning Dvorak, with daily practice, they could expect to be able to type without looking at the keyboard within two weeks. However, to get up to speed, months of practice may be needed. The amount of time can vary significantly depending on the user's commitment and whether they continue to use QWERTY.
</p>
  
  <h3>Tools and software.</h3>
  <p>It was briefly mentioned before, but there are very good websites to use without needing to immediately swap the computer's layout or change the keys on the keyboard. (We do not need to change the keys on the keyboard!). I highly suggest using keybr, though monkeytype with the right settings is definitely doable.</p>
  
  <h3>Typing communities/help.</h3>
  <p>The typing community (speed typing) has seen massive growth over the past few years and with the expansion of the internet, it is much easier to find other typing enthusiasts. One very great and notable YouTuber is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NoThisIsJohn">"NoThisIsJohn"</a>, who also has a Discord server with quite the typing community. Keybr also helps the user work on weaker letters. Keybr and monkeytype (if configured correctly) can both show an on-screen emulated keyboard to help the learning process.</p>
