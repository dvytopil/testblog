  <h2>Angles and latency make a huge difference.</h2>
    <h4>Ever been confused by why your opponent's move worked? You may have a vague understanding of angles and latency, but not how to take advantage or take control in your game. This article will explain how to use angles and latency to master your peaking technique in games to see enemies before they see you.</h4>
  
  <h3>Understanding Angles</h3>
  <p>Angles might seem simple but gets rather complex quite quickly. Understanding angles can give a player a massive improvement in performance and should be considered a core mechanic. In games, more often than not, there is a line of sight from the character's head that creates what you see on your screen. We must understand that when we are in cover, our vision might be covered but not anything else.</p>
    
  <p class="content">In the following images, the green ball is to represent one character while the red a second.</p>
    
  <figure class='content'>
      <img src="../images/fov1.png" alt="[Image of dvorak keyboard layout]" class="full-width-image">
      <figcaption>In this image the green character has no idea the red character is there.</figcaption>
  </figure>
    <figure class='content'>
      <img src="../images/fov2.png" alt="[Image of dvorak keyboard layout]" class="full-width-image">
      <figcaption>Here we can see that the red character can see the green character quite well.</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>It's clear there is a relationship between the position of the characters and how much they see of the other- especially in relation to obstacles or cover- but there is a lot more we can get from this relationship.</p>
    
  <figure class='content'>
      <img src="../images/lines.png" alt="[Image of dvorak keyboard layout]" class="full-width-image">
      <figcaption>This time the lines represent the point at which they can last see behind the obstacle.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>As Green moves towards the obstacle, the less the can see, and  they see less with each step- likewise, each step moving away is worth slightly less than the one before. You can imagine it like moving a flashlight closer and farther from an object. We will now add a use for this property. I understand this image may seem complicated at first- you will likely understand better if you see the next few.</p>
