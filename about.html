    <p>Hello, I am a nerd who is not so great at school.. anyhow, I've decided to make this project, which has taught me a lot about web applications. I play lots of video games, though I primarily rotate between valorant and roblox. I do not wish to disclose my name currently, regretably.</p>
    <p>Feel free to contact or request content, there is a high chance these things will happen. Feel free to join the discord server (which should be there if I have this stuff working right lmao).</p>
